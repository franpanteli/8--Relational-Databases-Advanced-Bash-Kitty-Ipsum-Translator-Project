These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Build a Kitty Ipsum Translator." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-advanced-bash-by-building-a-kitty-ipsum-translator/build-a-kitty-ipsum-translator

- This is a 140 lesson guided project
- This project is about commands -> more complex commands and how they work

To complete the guided project:
	- Copy the project boilerplate code in a Gitpod environment 
	- Open the command palette (command, shift, p)
	- CodeRoad: Start
	- Complete the guided project 

- You have to complete all of the project progress in one go (without backing out of Gitpod)
	- Otherwise your progress might not be saved in which case you would have to redo it
