# Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my eighth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-advanced-bash-by-building-a-kitty-ipsum-translator/build-a-kitty-ipsum-translator) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my Shell scripting and Bash skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/8--Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the eighth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Writing a Kitty Ipsum translator with Bash
### Problem Solving
For this project, I had to follow 140 Bash lessons in a Gitpod environment, to create a Kitty Ipsum translator. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/8--Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). This created the project [translate.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/translate.sh) file, to find and replace specific words in 'dog' placeholder text with their words in 'cat' placeholder text.

### Solution Workflow 
- To complete this guided project, its boilerplate files were first cloned in a Gitpod environment 
- 140 Bash lessons were followed in the project terminal. [In-depth notes were produced when completing this](https://github.com/franpanteli/8--Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-advanced-bash-kitty-ipsum-translator-project-course-notes.txt)
- Four peices of placeholder text for this project were used in English. Two of these peices of text were pertaining to dogs ([doggy_ipsum_1.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/doggy_ipsum_1.txt) and [doggy_ipsum_2.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/doggy_ipsum_2.txt)) and two to cats ([kitty_ipsum_1.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/kitty_ipsum_1.txt) and [kitty_ipsum_2.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/kitty_ipsum_2.txt))
- A test script file was devised as part of this ([script.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/script.sh)), to trial Bash commands on throughout the guided project. The standard errors and outputs of these test commands were redirected to the [stderr.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/stderr.txt) and [stdout.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/stdout.txt) files respectively
- More formalised outputs were redirected to the project [name.txt](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/name.txt) file and [notes on the commands trialled were made](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Advanced-Bash-Kitty-Ipsum-Translator-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-advanced-bash-kitty-ipsum-translator-project-course-notes.txt). This file contained more in depth information about the kitty placeholder text. The final shell file produced by this process is in the project problem solving section above
